## What Is Asp - Snake Oil
Asp is a store page themed around ideas of shady marketing, false promises and all things sketchy. I wanted to make a storefront but needed an angle I could get behind, and a snake oil scam quickly won me over. The website is simple yet sleek, shiny, new and feels stylistically similar to other modern websites, — health, tech or otherwise. Explore the **Home** page, learn more in the **About** section then navigate to **Shop** and fill up your cart. Once you’ve found what you’re looking for, **check out** on any page using the right side nav.

Miracles await!


## Thank you for giving my app a look :)
Have a great day!
